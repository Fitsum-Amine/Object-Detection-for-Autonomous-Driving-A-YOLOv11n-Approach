# Object-Detection-for-Autonomous-Driving-A-YOLOv11n-Approach
In this project we developed a 2D object detection network to identify cars from images derived from a downscaled KITTI dataset. The project employs the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture, YOLOv11n, which is a state-of-the-art model renowned for striking a balance between speed and accuracy.
